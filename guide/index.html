          Favicons!

          Webpack will automatically convert the high-resolution image saved to "assets/images/favicon.png"
          into a series of favicons for various devices like the browser, android, apple, windows, etc.

          By default, only the favicons for the browser are generated, but you can change that by modifying
          the settings for the FaviconsWebpackPlugin in the webpack config. The generated favicons all contain
          a unique hash in the URL to facilitate cache busting, and will look like this:

          <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicons-[hash]/favicon-32x32.png">
          <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/favicons-[hash]/favicon-16x16.png">
          <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicons-[hash]/favicon.ico">

          If you'd like to take full control over favicon generation process, or learn more about why
          favicon generation can be challenging, the Real Favicon Generator website is a great resource:

          Styles!

          Webpack will place your styles below this comment.

          In development, they will be included inline, like this:

          <style>
            ... your styles ...
          </style>

          In production, the ExtractTextPlugin in the webpack config will extract
          all styles and place them in a file called styles.main.css, which will be
          included like this:

          <link href="/styles.main.css" rel="stylesheet">

          To facilitate cache busting, this file will also contain a unique hash, to
          prevent browsers from using old styles once they've been updated. The final
          production file will look something like this:

          <link href="/styles.main.bb904647341499c464e6.css" rel="stylesheet">
        -->
</head>

<body id="app">
    <div class="loading-text">
        Loading...
    </div>
</body>

          Webpack will place your JavaScript bundles below this comment.

          The number of bundles your project has can have a large impact on your first
          page load time, since it takes longer to load one single large bundle (with
          all your code inside) compared to loading multiple smaller bundles that can
          be fetched in parallel.

          New Lore projects include two bundles by default. The first is called 'main'
          and includes the Lore core and your custom project files. The second is called
          'vendor' and includes vendor libraries like React, React DOM, and React Router.

          To further optimize the first page load time of your application, you are encouraged
          to add more libraries to the vendor bundle, or to create new bundles as needed.

          In development, the bundles will be included like this:

          <script type="text/javascript" src="/bundle.vendor.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/bundle.main.js"></script>

          In production, in order to facilitate cache busting, these files will also contain a
          unique hash, to prevent browsers from using old files once they've been updated. The
          final production files will look something like this:

          <script type="text/javascript" src="/bundle.vendor.bbf77f84f00fd43296cb.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/bundle.main.bb904647341499c464e6.js"></script>
        -->
